Manchester University - Matt Hendryx ECON221,ECON221 Economics,4,"He is a really great teacher. I wasn't so sure I would like Microeconomics, and he has made it interesting. Don't waste your money on buying the $100 book, we never used it. You must also pass the fundamentals test to even pass the class, which is a downfall for anyone with test anxiety. The information is presented in a understandable manner.",UmF0aW5nLTE1MDc2NjY3
Manchester University - Matt Hendryx ECON221,ECON221 Economics,4,"There are three parts to this course: lecture notes, in-class activities, and the Fundamentals test.

DigiPen Institute of Technology - Antoine Abi Chacra CS230,CS230 Computer Science,4,"CS 230 is a pretty silly class, it only exists to go along with GAM 150 so you can actually make a game. It would be better to go along with GAM 200, and cover component based design and actual graphics implementation, at least in my opinion. The professor, though, does teach the class well, and grades fairly, and did not create the curriculum.",UmF0aW5nLTIyOTIzOTc3

The Schulich School of Business - York - Margaret Hastings 6140G,6140G Marketing,2,"Her grading makes no sense at all. She has a different rubric for grading that she does not share with the class.

Not very accommodating.",UmF0aW5nLTM0ODQ0MjA0

Worked so hard and got a B- (the lowest grade in my entire MBA). And I was in the top few of the class. More than half the class was given C+ or lesser.

I didnt open it once and still got an A just from in class participation points/quiz points and studying the slide",UmF0aW5nLTE5MjIxNDcx
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,1,The class consists 50% of watching YouTube videos and the other 50% reading from slides. You will not learn anything from this class. Show up to earn your attendance points and take the daily quiz. I recommend bringing a laptop to keep yourself busy otherwise you will go mad.,UmF0aW5nLTE4NTg4ODAz
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,2,"Lecture is fine, entertaining to listen to. However, absolutely rude, demeaning, and disrespectful to students after class.",UmF0aW5nLTIzMjQ1MDEx
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,2,YouTube videos and publisher slides. At least the attendance points and daily quizzes boost your grade. Tests are usually over 70 questions but not that difficult.,UmF0aW5nLTE4NjQ1MTg5
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA352,BA352 Business,5,"Prof. Elton is one of the best teachers in the COB. He is really funny during class and his teaching style keeps everyone interested. If you like classes that are fun while you still learn, then Elton is a must for you!",UmF0aW5nLTE3Njk1NjE4
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,3,"Fairly easy course. Go to all the classes (Qwizdom points) and you should do fine on the tests with a little review. Elton was entertaining but was not always the most clear on the concepts we were going over; however, the Powerpoints are usually all you need anyway.",UmF0aW5nLTE4ODIyNTcw
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA495,BA495 Business,1,"Horrible teacher. This guy is a joke! I bet his students know more than he does, he is just a clown. Easy grade, won't help your career one bit.",UmF0aW5nLTE3Mjk5NzMx
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,3,"This is my third class w Mark.He is very fun/entertaining.I am concerned that he continues to show same U-tube & persuaders videos 4 3 very different BA classes. I hope to learn/see something new. He has open door policy and easy to approach. Has quizzes each class so people show up. Don't leave during lecture, he really frowns on that.",UmF0aW5nLTEzOTgxMzM1
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA516,BA516 Business,3,Easy class. Consists of watching commercials on youtube and looking at powerpoint slides. He grades tests and projects very slowly.,UmF0aW5nLTIyMTAzNzQz
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA499,BA499 Business,4,"Professor is great. Really knows how to make class not dreadful. Usually two hours classes are always awful, but Professor Elton makes the two hours move by quickly and generally efficiently.",UmF0aW5nLTE5ODIxNzM2
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,1,he is one of the worst professors i have ever had. The tests do not resemble his lectures at all. If you want a good grade I do not recommend him at all!,UmF0aW5nLTEzNzIwMzM1
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BABUSI,BABUSI Business,4,"nice teacher, really fun, interesting but sometimes rude and self concious about how right he is. We were talking about an economic concept which he was wrong about, I raised my hand to politely correct him. Instead he did a face saving maneuver to use his popularity to insult me and my idea in front of everyone even though he admitted fault later",UmF0aW5nLTEzODQ4MzY3
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA495,BA495 Business,3,"Love, Love, Love him! there is a method to his madness, some students hate it, most love it. He will not do your work for you, he wants you to learn and think (he will help you tons!) Go to class! Pay attention, you'll hardly have to study for his exams (which are common sense....)",UmF0aW5nLTE2NjEzNjY5
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,3,This class is easy but so boring! Take something to keep you entertained because listening to Mark's lecture's will put you to sleep.  Don't be fooled by the Mark's first couple lectures.  He lures you in with some good youtube vids but it's all downhill from there.,UmF0aW5nLTE1MzAzOTA2
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA492,BA492 Business,4,"THIS GUY IS THE BOMB! You need to show up because he is so cool, and a lot of what he goes over in class is on the midterm and final. (If you have one!)",UmF0aW5nLTE2ODgxNTU1
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA516,BA516 Business,3,"Class was really easy, but I don't feel like I learned a lot. Lectures consist of publisher powerpoint slides and watching commercials on youtube. He is really slow to grade tests and projects. His expectations for assignments aren't very clear.",UmF0aW5nLTIyMTAzNzMw
Oregon State University - Mark Elton PSM566,PSM566 Business,2,"I had an on-line class where we met 4 times a term.  He is awful, doesn't care, used very old materials, not a good professor.",UmF0aW5nLTIyMzMxODMx
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA495,BA495 Business,1,"If you plan on learning anything, get a different professor, if college is about breezing through and getting a degree, he's your man. USELESS USELESS USELESS!!! I did not learn anything in this class",UmF0aW5nLTE3MjAwMTI5
Oregon State University - Mark Elton BA390,BA390 Business,5,"Fun class, you sit and watch commercials most of the time.  Pretty easy, you just have to show up.",UmF0aW5nLTE1OTAxNjEx

Arizona Western College - Samuel Shearrow MAT151,MAT151 Mathematics,5,"Mr.Shearrow is a wonderful professor who will help any students during office hours. I was very lucky to have him for 3 classes 81,121,151. I am terrible at math very terrible but he will answer every single question (if you ask). I say this because many people are afraid to ask questions. Do not be hesitant to ask anything. I highly recommend..",UmF0aW5nLTIzNTY5NzIx
Arizona Western College - Samuel Shearrow MATH122,MATH122 Mathematics,4,Great teacher. I would recomend him to anyone. He makes learning fun and easy.,UmF0aW5nLTE2Mzc5NzE1

West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung NURS5,NURS5 Nursing,5,"He is the best nursing theory instructor. Not only will he teach you the materials but also how to study to be successful. Every student in my class passed the exit exam because of his dedication to his students. You will need to work hard to pass his class, but at the end, it's totally worth it.",UmF0aW5nLTI3OTUwNDIy
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung NURS3,NURS3 Nursing,5,"He is the best instructor in the LVN nursing program. He made confusing material really easy to understand. He loves to help students, and always make time to meet with us. Although his tests are challenging, I sure learned a lot this term.",UmF0aW5nLTI2MTcxNjEx
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung NCLEX1,NCLEX1 Nursing,5,Attending his weekend NCLEX review class was a lot of work. But I'm so thankful that he taught this review class because I passed my NCLEX last month on the first try. I highly recommend him!,UmF0aW5nLTI3MTQ2NzA3
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung TERM5,TERM5 Nursing,5,This is toughest class I've taken in my entire schooling. He is great in explaining materials that are difficult to understand and always provide tips to crack the NCLEX tricky questions.,UmF0aW5nLTMxMDk1MDMy
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung NURS5,NURS5 Nursing,5,"I belong to a small class but everyone passed the tough ATI with level 2 and above every term. I hated all the homework he assigned, but at the end those really helped me. He would give hundreds of practice questions and go over them one by one with test taking strategies.  He is the best teacher!",UmF0aW5nLTI2NzIwNzM2
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung N3,N3 Nursing,5,Great lecture and test taking strategy presented in class. I passed the ATI subject test because of him. He will listen to you because he truly cares. He responds to his email promptly as well. I'd love to have him as my professor for the rest of the term.,UmF0aW5nLTI2MjEzNjk0
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung NURS5,NURS5 Nursing,5,He is by far the toughest instructor but I learned so much from him. He takes him to go over the questions and rationales as well as test taking strategies. He is accessible outside of class all the time. I texted/emailed him questions and he will always respond. He is the best of the best!!!,UmF0aW5nLTMwNDI1OTg0
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung T5,T5 Nursing,5,"I pass the boards because of him. His course is rigorous but that is why I pass my NCLEX the first time.

You would want to give up, but he will held out his hand to pull you up!",UmF0aW5nLTI2NzQ5OTM0
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung NURS5,NURS5 Nursing,5,"He is an awesome LVN theory instructor. The only thing is there's a lot of homework to finish before the test and his tests are hard. But if you score well, you will pass the ATI assessment for sure. So that's a plus.",UmF0aW5nLTI3ODkwMjcy
West Coast Ultrasound Institute - Jordan Hung TERM5,TERM5 Nursing,5,"He is the best nursing instructor I've ever had. He is very clear in his teaching and made the learning materials easier to understand. His tests are hard and involve a lot of critical thinking.

University of Connecticut Avery Point - Janice Watts CHEM1107,CHEM1107 Chemistry,1,"She is so boring. Everyone who was in my lab group failed. Class is only at 8am, everyone sleeps during class. AVOID THIS CLASS-- TAKE PSYCHICS WITH MILLBACH FOR YOUR SCIENCE/LAB COURSE.",UmF0aW5nLTE3ODg0MDY4
University of Connecticut Avery Point - Janice Watts CHEM1122,CHEM1122 Chemistry,4,"Watts is EXTREMELY boring. She hardly every curves. Since she is so boring it is hard to pay attention. She speaks in a monotone and reads right off the slides. She assigns hmwk right out of the book, so be sure to get it! The book was the only reason I passed. The labs were hard and had almost nothing to do with what we did in class.",UmF0aW5nLTE3MDYwNzg0
Trine University - Brooks Bigelow CHEM1,CHEM1 Chemistry,3,"Easiest teacher to get out of class early.  All you need to do is sit there with a cigarette in you mouth and you are guaranteed to get out of class 20 mins early.  He know his stuff, but isn't all that clear when it comes to informing the students.",UmF0aW5nLTEwMzgxNTQz

Trine University - Brooks Bigelow CHEM114,CHEM114 Chemistry,1,"He is incredibly intelligent, but he definitely lacks in the teaching department.  Don't take him for an intro class, he expects you to have a huge background already so he doesn't explain himself.  He will write things on the board and you won't know where they came from.",UmF0aW5nLTEzNjYxMDkz

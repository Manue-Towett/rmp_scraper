James Madison University - Bruce Johnson GENG221,GENG221 English,3,"Johnson is really intelligent and interesting. I really enjoyed this class even though, i'm usually more of a science person. TAKE HIM! He really isn't that bad. The only reason I got a very high B is because I screwed up the midterm b/c of mono. One of the best profs at JMU i've had so far.",UmF0aW5nLTIwMjEyMTIw
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson HON300,HON300 English,5,"Johnson is really cool. I had my doubts about this class but he makes it a lot of fun. Expect lots of class discussions with very few actual lectures. There are three papers, a midterm, a final, and some quizzes spread throughout the semester. The papers aren't that hard and he gives you clear instructions. Would take again.",UmF0aW5nLTI3OTYxMTU0
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG309,ENG309 English,5,"He is the sweetest. He really wants to help you. He teaches at the pace the class can handle which I really appreciated. If we were not ready to be quizzed on a topic, he would wait until he felt like we were ready. You have to do the homework and put in the effort. If you want to do the minimal amount of work, this is not the class for you.",UmF0aW5nLTMwMDQyOTE0
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG321,ENG321 English,5,I LOVE BRUCE! He's a really funny and just nice guy.  Super helpful and always willing to answer questions (even if that means going way off-topic).  I'm definitely going to take him again.  Work load isn't too bad as long as you keep up with the readings for the mini quizzes in class.,UmF0aW5nLTIxMDMyNzk5
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG299,ENG299 English,5,"Johnson is the man! Love his class. His is so nice and super helpful when it comes to giving feedback. He wants you to be successful & states exactly what he expects from you. lets you venture your own path when it comes to the writing assignments (theres 3). There are daily quizzes in this class but if you do the readings, they arent hard at all.",UmF0aW5nLTI3MzEwNjQy
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson HUMANITIES,HUMANITIES English,2,"Ughh, he's got to be THE MOST boring lecturer in the whole humanities series.  I couldn't stand the way he kept repeating his thesis (like a million times) Hello! enough is enough!  We get the message!",UmF0aW5nLTIxNzM3NzY=
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG299,ENG299 English,4,"I really liked Dr. Johnson! He chooses interesting pieces for reading material, and you have discussions in class. There were 3 papers and a midterm and final, and quizzes almost every class. It may sound daunting, but it really isn't once you get into the swing of things! I would definitely take this class again!",UmF0aW5nLTMxODI4Nzkx
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG299,ENG299 English,3,"One of the sweetest professors. I took his 299 class last year and am currently enrolled in his Grammar 309 course this semester. He's not the easiest professor, he expects a lot of self-learning out of his students and quizzes heavily. Although, he is incredibly flexible and willing to help through office hours! Highly recommended! ",UmF0aW5nLTI1MzQxNzIz
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson HUM1A,HUM1A English,4,"Clark talks more about the historical aspect of Huckleberry Finn, Rowlandson, and Crevecour. He's not a bad lecturer but he's not outstanding either.",UmF0aW5nLTExMDk5NTgz
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG299,ENG299 English,5,"Can't say enough good things about him. Interesting reading material, interesting discussion, & he is very knowledgeable but not unapproachable at all. When you turn in final drafts of papers he lets you get peer edits & then change things on the paper you turn in at the last minute, it's very helpful. You will learn a lot & feel motivated by him.",UmF0aW5nLTE2ODQyNDc1
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG309,ENG309 English,5,"Professor Johnson is like if a smile was a person. I'm not a massive fan of grammar, but he made it fun, useful, and easy. I love this man with my entire soul",UmF0aW5nLTMxMTE5NDE5
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson GHUM200,GHUM200 English,5,"This has been my favorite professor so far at JMU. Really nice and cool guy. It does require reading almost every night and small quizzes on the reading that are graded by ur classmates. If you are willing to do the reading, you can come out with an A in this class.",UmF0aW5nLTE1MDEyNTAy
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson HUMCORE,HUMCORE English,5,"His lectures were clear and usually concise.  His use of artwork to explain the themes of the book was at the least helpful, at the least innovative.  An excellent teacher, I only wish he could replace the three weeks of Van Sant.",UmF0aW5nLTEwODYyMjM1
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG310,ENG310 English,5,a great professor who genuinely cares about his students and trusts them. he is a personable guy and respects everyone's opinions. attendance isn't taken but there are quizzes each class. even though I was allowed two skips I didn't take any because I actually wanted to be in class.,UmF0aW5nLTMyMzMzNjcw
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG410,ENG410 English,4,"Bruce is amazing! I took his Eng 299 class and loved it. He makes a lot of quizzes and his answers are pretty specific, so make sure to read. Before a paper is due, go to his office hours. He is really helpful and it will likely boost your grade for the paper. Several opportunities for extra credit. ",UmF0aW5nLTI1MDU3NjAx
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson HUMCORE1B,HUMCORE1B English,3,i don't sleep in class and i could not for the life of me keep my eyes open.,UmF0aW5nLTI2OTM4MTU=
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson GENG221,GENG221 English,3,Very nice man. Most of the class time consisted of discussions about the material read the night before. He will call on random people to participate in the discussions. His tests are hard but the papers were not too bad (you have 3 of them). Lectures can be confusing and hard to follow but otherwise good professor,UmF0aW5nLTIwMDUyMzQ3
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG309,ENG309 English,5,"Johnson is the sweetest! He really cares about his students, whether that means success in his class or outside it. Some people in my class complained that they couldn't follow what he was saying, but they can't expect to vibe well with every professor they meet. Johnson really does his best to make grammar as easy to digest as possible! Take him!!",UmF0aW5nLTMyNDM4MDQx
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson GHUM200,GHUM200 English,4,"Bruce Johnson is the best teacher I have ever had. He really wants you to do well in the class. Go to class every day because there are daily quizzes on the readings assigned. There are 3 papers which are definitely challenging so don't leave them until the last minute. Great class, Johnson is funny and knows what hes talking about.",UmF0aW5nLTE1MjkwOTMy
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson CRIT100B,CRIT100B English,2,"The reading list for the course was interesting and texts were compelling, though he did not inspire, and discussions were often dry when they could have been engaging.  A bit too ivory-towerish.",UmF0aW5nLTIxODk4MDk=
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG309,ENG309 English,3,"He gives at least 1-2 quizzes per class and then you switch quizzes with a partner and grade them. And then, he goes down the attendance list and everyone reads their grade-not good. and this happens-every single class.",UmF0aW5nLTI5Njc4NDg1
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson GENG221,GENG221 English,5,I LOVE BRUCE.  Such a cool guy and one of the BEST english profs I have ever had.  I read the assinged books and worked hard on the papers but i loved it!  I had more fun and learned more in his class than several classes combined.  TAKE Bruce but be prepared to write thorogh papers,UmF0aW5nLTIxNTI4ODU0
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson GENG221,GENG221 English,5,"Dr Johnson is amazing. I know way more about CS Lewis than I ever wanted but he made the class as easy as possible. Reading quiz every class but they're easy questions and you grade it yourself; at the very least sparknote it and you'll do okay. Gives random points out, but 2 big papers he grades pretty tough on. Weird but easy and enjoyable GenEd",UmF0aW5nLTMzMjk2OTAz
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG299,ENG299 English,4,"Definitely suggest taking him. Interesting readings, great lectures, funny guy. He can be a bit of a tough grader on papers, but it will only make you better, and he's totally willing to work with you. Great class, awesome professor!",UmF0aW5nLTI2MjIxMzgx
James Madison University - Bruce Johnson ENG315,ENG315 English,3,"The class was titled &quot;17th Century British Poetry&quot; & should have been titled &quot;17th Century British History&quot; Although he is a nice guy & a good teacher, he was not good at teaching this class. We rarely discussed the poems and the paper assignments were unreasonable and vague. My advice, take Johnson but a different class that he teaches.",UmF0aW5nLTEzOTk3Nzk3
Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENGL2000,ENGL2000 English,3,"Difficult class, but well worth the effort.  You'll come out of the class with a very good understanding of the material that was covered.",UmF0aW5nLTEyNDI5MDI3

Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENG102,ENG102 English,2,"He's the worst teacher they have at AASU. If you want an F than take him, yeah he's smart but he's  really rude and likes embarassing students if they don't know something. Fire him!",UmF0aW5nLTM2Njc1MDI=
Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENGL1102,ENGL1102 English,4,"Very Bright.  He is also very hard.  If you take Mr. Martin, do so knowing this.  He is not going to give you anything.  You are going to have to work for every point.  I received a B in his class; a hard B.  Looking back, I wouldn't have had it any other way.  If you are serious about college and being a good student, I recommend him.",UmF0aW5nLTM4NjU1NTE=
Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENG2100,ENG2100 English,1,"Never ever take him on a summer semester.  He will not slack up a bit.  He uses the statement that he will not dumb down the corse just because of the short length.  In the end that is exactly what he does, since you have to cram 5 substantial novel in and be able to grasp their full meanings.",UmF0aW5nLTEwMDg4MTE3

Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENGLISH2100,ENGLISH2100 English,5,"It seems that his 1101 and 1102 classes are pretty hard.  His 2100 class is only reading novels, which are not hard at all.  For example: The Great Gatsby.  Two small papers and an essay midterm and final.  He is very smart and like everyone else says he doesn't give away grades.",UmF0aW5nLTEwOTkyMzIw
Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENGL1102,ENGL1102 English,4,"He's not an easy A, but he's a lot of fun. He's a funny, old, bald man with a crazy hearing problem. He's really old fashioned about the way he runs his classroom. If you're chronically tardy, you may as well expect an F. He takes an absent for each tardy. He is a lot of fun and he really knows what he's talking about.",UmF0aW5nLTExMjY4NDk0
Georgia Southern University - Armstrong - William Martin ENG1101,ENG1101 English,3,"His class discussions were a joke. Weeks of worksheets on the difference between it's, its, there, they're, their, to, too... etc. etc.  When it came time to have papers graded it was surprising to see I had a C-!! He didn't grade on what he taught at all. I would definitely NOT take his class.",UmF0aW5nLTMzNjAxMTg=

University of Delaware - Kathleen McCoy CISC108,CISC108 Computer Science,2,Just wants to help but was not very good at explaining herself. Her classes are behind the labs so you will show up to lab and just be sitting there clueless and the Lab TA's do not help at all. It's pretty bad because it could have been a great class if taught right.,UmF0aW5nLTIzMDE1NzY0

University of Delaware - Kathleen McCoy CISC108,CISC108 Computer Science,2,She is a very nice woman who definitely means well but most of the time she seems really confused.

We didn't learn Java but were thrown into a java lab. i recommend taking another professor.,UmF0aW5nLTIxNzY0OTky
University of Delaware - Kathleen McCoy CISC890,CISC890 Computer Science,5,"On new graduate student orientation, professor McCoy as our chair gave an inspirational speech to welcome everyone.

University of Delaware - Kathleen McCoy CISC108,CISC108 Computer Science,5,"Very good professor who really wants to help her students understand computer science.

University of Delaware - Kathleen McCoy CISC108,CISC108 Computer Science,1,"Dr. McCoy is freaking clown shoes. Like Eli, she is the best mayne, she deed it. That means she's completely awful. She once did check-expects for 40 minutes until she realized she was doing it wrong and then proceeded to correct herself for another 10-15 minutes, and then for the remaining 20 taught the material she intended, poorly at that.",UmF0aW5nLTE4NDgyNTI2

University of Delaware - Kathleen McCoy CISC108,CISC108 Computer Science,2,"The class is basically based on the lab.
